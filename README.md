## Project Structure

This project utilizes Vite for fast development and React for building user interfaces.


### React

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable components which manage their own state, making it easier to develop and maintain complex UIs.

#### Reasons for using React:

- **Speed**: Enhances page loading speed and overall user experience.
- **Flexibility**: Easier to maintain and more adaptable due to its modular structure.
- **React Bootstrap**: Provides pre-built components for improved styling and responsiveness.
- **Reusability**: Facilitates the creation and reuse of components across the application.

### Components

- `<FeedForm />`: Manages the input form for creating new feed items.
- `<FeedItem />`: Displays individual feed items.
- `<Footer />`: Provides the footer section of the application.
- `<NavBar />`: Contains navigation links and user profile actions.
- `<ProfileInfo />`: Displays user profile information.
- `<Toast />`: Handles toast notifications for user feedback.

### Pages

- **Home**: The main landing page of the application.
- **Edit Profile**: Allows users to update their profile information.
- **Feed**: Displays a list of feed items.
- **Friends**: Manages user's friend list and friend requests.
- **Login**: User login page.
- **Signup**: User registration page.
- **Post**: Handles creating and viewing individual posts.
- **Profile**: Displays the user's profile page.
- **Search**: Provides search functionality for users and posts.

### Contexts

- **ToastContext**: Manages toast notifications.
- **UserContext**: Handles user authentication and profile information.
- **SearchContext**: Manages the search functionality.
- **PostsContext**: Manages posts, including creating, editing, and deleting posts.
- **FriendshipContext**: Manages friendships and friend requests.

### Providers

All contexts are wrapped in the `AppProviders` component to provide global state management.


## Bug

### Issue Description

When a user manually types the URL of a feed item in the browser without being authenticated, the feed item is visible, but the user cannot make requests due to the lack of authentication token.


<details>
  <summary>FeedItem bug</summary>
  <img src="readme-media/feeditem-bug.png" alt="feed item bug">
</details>

### Proposed Solution

To address this issue, we can conditionally render the feed form based on the user's authentication status. The `isAuthenticated` flag is already available in the `UserContext`, which manages user authentication state throughout the application.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Context Integration**: Ensure `isAuthenticated` is properly managed in `UserContext` and accessible throughout the application.

2. **Conditional Rendering**: Modify the rendering logic for the feed form component (`<FeedForm />`) to check the `isAuthenticated` flag before displaying the form.

   Solution:
   ```jsx
   import { useContext } from 'react';
   import { UserContext } from './UserContext';

   const FeedForm = () => {
     const { isAuthenticated } = useContext(UserContext);

     return isAuthenticated ? (
       <div>
         {/* Render feed form content */}
       </div>
     ) : (
       <></> // Render nothing or a placeholder if user is not authenticated
     );
   };

   export default FeedForm;
